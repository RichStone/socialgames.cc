## Tracking Scores in Offline Games

Social Games is a score tracker, where you can track scores in 
games that you play offline against your fiercest opponents. Whether you
forgot pen and paper for your UNO party outside in the park or you want
to see the long term ping pong stats against your fiercest opponents,
Social Games has you covered.

## Open Source

Social Games is open source. Apart from being a score tracker, it's a
sample app to showcase how to build a Rails app on steroid with the
Bullet Train framework.

It also showcases how to build a web app marketing-first so you can get
your marketing messaging right early on, get your first users _before_ you
launch and delegate the heavy lifting of managing users and their subscriptions
to a third party API that actually figured all this out for you.
We use [the public ClickFunnels API](https://developers.myclickfunnels.com)
for this.
